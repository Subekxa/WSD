            <li>What is the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)?</li>
            <p>The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application-layer method of sending hypertext documents
                including HTML. It was intended to allow web browsers and servers to interact, but it can also be used
                for other applications.</p>

            <li>Why is HTTP called a stateless protocol?</li>
            <p>HTTP is known as a stateless protocol because each requirement is implemented individually, with no
                knowledge of previous requests which implies when the transaction lasts, the communication between both
                the browser and the server is also lost.</p>

            <li>Describe the three phases of establishing a session using client-server protocols such as HTTP?</li>
            <p>In client-server protocols, like HTTP, sessions consist of three phases:

                a. The client establishes a TCP connection (or the appropriate connection if the transport layer is not
                TCP).
                b. The client sends its request, and waits for the answer.
                c. The server processes the request, sending back its answer, providing a status code and appropriate
                data.</p>

            <li>Describe the parameters on a get and post request.</li>
            <p>Both the GET and POST methods are used to transmit data from client to the server in the HTTP protocol.
                The main difference between the two methods is that the GET method appends the request parameter towards
                the URL string, while the POST method appends the request parameter towards the message body, creating a
                more stable way of data transfer from client to the server in the HTTP protocol.</p>

            <li>What are the HTTP response status code and What do the HTTP status codes, 200, and 404 indicate?</li>
            <p>HTTP response status codes show whether or not such a specific HTTP request has completed successfully.
                The 404 status code is the most well-known among them all, signifying that the requested resource was
                not found at the given URL, and the server has no understanding how long it took to locate anything.
            </p>

            <li>What are HTTP cookies? Give an example.</li>
            <p>An HTTP cookie (web cookie, browser cookie) is a small piece of data that a server sends to the user's web browser.
               For example, if Path=/docs is set, these paths match:
               /docs.
               /docs/Web/
               /docs/Web/HTTP.

            </p>

            <li>Why are cookies a security issue?</li>
            <p>Cookies aren't damaging because the data their record doesn't change. They can't create viruses or other
                software to infect computers. Some cyberattacks, on the other hand, can hijack cookies and even get
                access to your personal data. Their ability to track peoples personal web browsing history poses a risk.
            </p>

            <li>Describe session hijacking and XSS.</li>
            <p>A session hijacking attack happens when an attacker takes over your internet session. Attacker can then do
                anything you could do on the site. In effect, a hijacker fools the website into thinking they are you.
                Cross-site scripting (commonly known as XSS) is a web security flaw that allows an attacker to manipulate how 
                users interact with a susceptible application.
            </p>

            <li>Describe Cross-site request forgery(CSRF)</li>
            <p>Cross-site request forgery (widely known as CSRF) is a web security problem that allows an attacker to
                mislead users towards doing things they don't like to do. It allows an attacker to completely bypass the
                same origin policy, which is created to keep websites from engaging with each other.</p>


            <li>What are Cross-site HTTP requests (CORS) and what requests use CORS?</li>
            <p>CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) is an HTTP header-based system that allows a server to identify any
                alternative origins (domain, scheme, or port) through which a browsers can enable resource loading.
                <br> Simple requests <br>
                a. GET. <br>
                b. HEAD. <br>
                c. POST.
